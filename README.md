## 🧠 What I Build

I build intelligent backend systems with clean, product-aware frontends.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- 🤖 AI-powered conversational systems
- 🏗 Scalable backend architecture
- ⚡ Modern full-stack development
- 📊 Product-driven thinking

I'm especially interested in how AI systems integrate into real-world backend infrastructures — not just calling APIs, but **designing systems around them**.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

Most of my work revolves around:

- NLP-based chatbot development (Rasa, LLM integrations)
- Node.js & Express backend services
- RESTful APIs & WebSocket communication
- PostgreSQL & Prisma ORM
- Microservice-ready architecture patterns
- React / Next.js frontend integrations

I enjoy designing layered architectures and building systems that are clean, modular, and scalable.

## 🤖 AI Focus

I've worked on:

- Intent & entity modeling
- Context-aware chatbot systems
- AI module research & evaluation
- LLM integration experiments
- Real-time AI-backed interfaces

My goal is not just to "use AI" — but to **engineer systems around it**.

---

## 🏗 Backend Philosophy

- Clear separation of concerns
- Controller → Service → Data layers
- Authentication & authorization logic
- Documentation-first API design
- Debuggable, maintainable systems

> *Good backend is invisible — until it fails.*  
> I try to build the kind that doesn't.

---

## 📈 Product Perspective

Beyond engineering, I have startup experience in digital growth and user behavior.

That background helps me think in terms of:

- User impact
- Feature prioritization
- System usability
- Real-world scalability

I don't just ask *"Does it work?"*  
I ask *"Does it create value?"*
